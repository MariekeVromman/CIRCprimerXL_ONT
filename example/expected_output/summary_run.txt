3 circRNAs were given as input
	for 3 circRNAs (100.0 %), primer pairs were designed and filtered succesfully 
	for 0 circRNAs (0.0 %), no primer pairs could be designed by primer3
	for 0 circRNAs (0.0 %), none of the primer pairs passed all filters

in total
	21 primer pairs were designed and tested
	20 (95.2 %) primer pairs passed all filters
	0 (0.0 %) primer pairs failed the specicifity filter
	0 (0.0 %) primer pairs failed the SNP filter
	0 (0.0 %) primer pairs failed the secundary structure of the template filter
	1 (4.8 %) primer pairs failed the secundary structure of the amplicon filter

3 circRNA(s) were given as input
	for 3 circRNA(s) (100.0 %), primer pair(s) were designed and filtered succesfully 
	for 0 circRNA(s) (0.0 %), the (spliced) template sequence was to short and no primer pair(s) could be designed by primer3
	for 0 circRNA(s) (0.0 %), no primer pair(s) could be designed by primer3
	for 0 circRNA(s) (0.0 %), none of the primer pair(s) passed all filters

in total
	20 primer pair(s) were designed and tested
	20 (100.0 %) primer pairs passed all filters
	0 (0.0 %) primer pair(s) failed the specificity filter
	0 (0.0 %) primer pair(s) failed the secondary structure of the amplicon filter

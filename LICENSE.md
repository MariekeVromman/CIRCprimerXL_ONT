Limitation of Liability.

The   intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the   development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open   source and free software.<br>     <br>     You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this   license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms   of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the   Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different   licensing arrangement.<br>     <br>     Definitions<br>     "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)   named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.<br>     <br>     "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other   material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's   procedures.<br>     <br>     "You" and "your" means any person who would like to   copy, distribute, or modify the Package.<br>     <br>     "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the   Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A   given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified   Version.<br>     <br>     "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it   accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to   others outside of your company or organization.<br>     <br>     "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing   this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does   not mean licensing fees.<br>     <br>     "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been   modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the   Copyright Holder.<br>     <br>     "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and   such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.<br>     <br>     "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed   with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may   be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.<br>     <br>     "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and   configuration files for the Package.<br>     <br>     "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,   or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of   the Source form.<br>     <br>     Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution<br>     (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use   Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do   not Distribute the Modified Version.<br>     <br>     Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version<br>     (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard   Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or   for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original   copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such   verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.<br>     <br>     (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other   modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package   will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to   the Original License.<br>     <br>     Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source<br>     (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or   for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified   Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard   Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard   features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of   the following:<br>     <br>     (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the   Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder   may include your modifications in the Standard Version.<br>     (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the   user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified   Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard   Version.<br>     (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the   Source form of the Modified Version available to others under<br>     (i) the Original License or<br>     (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and   redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply   to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of   the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely   available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are   allowed.<br>     <br>     Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions   without the Source<br>     (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the   Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the   Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time   of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are   carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new   instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid   instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware   that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights   under this license.<br>     <br>     (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the   Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of   the Modified Version.<br>     <br>     Aggregating or Linking the Package<br>     (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified   Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation   provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor   Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the   aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and   Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the   aggregation.<br>     <br>     (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other   works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build   stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the   Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result   does not expose a direct interface to the Package.<br>     <br>     Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version<br>     (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely   extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package   to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of   the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.<br>     <br>     General Provisions<br>     (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified   Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or   distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or   distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.<br>     <br>     (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made   by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your   Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.<br>     <br>     (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,   service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.<br>     <br>     (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge   patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and   otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable   by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package.
